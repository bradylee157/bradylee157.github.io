			<h1>Disciple Making at EP</h1>
			<h2>Congregational Assessment Tool</h2>
			<p>Jesus&rsquo;s command to make disciples has been part of our church&rsquo;s DNA since its founding, and disciple-making remains central as EP makes the shift from attraction to mission.</p>
			<p>This focus on disciple-making will not change.</p>
			<p>Indeed, we view it as the key to helping us address the unity the CAT revealed on our direction as a church. To review, the CAT was clear that we as a church want to:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Reach new people and incorporate them into the life of the church.</li>
				<li>Create more opportunities for people to form meaningful relationships.</li>
				<li>Strengthen the process by which attenders are called and equipped for ministry and leadership.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The Disciple-Making Initiative will help us do all three. It will provide space for us as a congregation to be unified in creating opportunities for people to form meaningful relationships, and it will equip us as a church for mission and ministry. Naturally, relationally-capable, equipped believers will be more effective in reaching new people.</p>

			<h2>Family</h2>
			<p>Here&rsquo;s what I envision when I think about the disciple-making initiative: I picture sitting in someone&rsquo;s living room. My newborn daughter is next to me in her car seat. My other daughter is running around, playing, with a few of the other kids. The group has just shared a meal together, and now we are working through the evening&rsquo;s lesson, learning from one another and thinking through how to live the Gospel in our contexts.</p>
			<p>The environment is warm. This is home base for my wife and me during the week, the place where we can most be ourselves—share our struggles and debrief the positive or negative encounters we&rsquo;ve had during the previous week. There are people our age, but there are also folks our parents and even grandparents age who shower us with love, wisdom, and acceptance. We have learned so much from them, and they&rsquo;ve learned from us.</p>
			<p>Life is rich with them in my life, not because we are all the same, but because there is unity in our diversity. Together we have become more fluent in how to engage with our culture, which naturally leads us to reach new people. Because we know our identity in the Lord, we are free to be a non-anxious presence in life&rsquo;s difficult situations. When we interact with our non-believing friends, we feel comfortable inviting them into this group, because this is our family.</p>
			<p>Who doesn&rsquo;t want to share a warm meal with warm people and talk about what matters most in life? Who doesn&rsquo;t need a safe place to struggle, to process, to laugh, to cry? This group positions me to live a renewed life well, with others and for Christ.</p>
			<h2>Threads</h2>
			<p>One of the striking things about where we are as a church is that we have together identified where we can improve as a body. We could do better at hospitality. We want to do ministry but do not necessarily feel equipped to do so. We could handle conflict better.</p>
			<p>As a result of this and other pain points, we as a church feel a bit stuck—we struggle with how we will unite as a body and engage, connect with, and transform our city and culture.</p>
			<p>The Disciple-Making Initiative recognizes and seeks to address these issues. What better way to improve hospitality than to learn to model it with one another in the context of small, intimate communities that (predominantly) meet in houses? How better to equip ourselves for ministry than to learn together the way of our Lord as he ministered—to know our identity, to grow, and then to love the way he did?</p>
			<p>It is precisely in response to the feedback you gave and the direction the elders have chosen that we are implementing this curriculum, which is not solely or even primarily about mastering content, but about shaping character with one another to position us to renew Annapolis as we are being renewed by the Gospel.</p>
			<h2>Values</h2>
			<h3>Gospel Centrality</h3>
			<p>God&rsquo;s love for his world through his Son Jesus Christ is central to all we do. It gives life to everything else, and without it nothing can be done that is worth doing.</p>
			<h3>Community Through Mission</h3>
			<p>Community is not the end goal of our common life together; mission is. Through focus on God&rsquo;s mission to his world, our common life together is rich, impactful, and will never stop within its own walls.</p>
			<h3>Model God&rsquo;s Renewed Family</h3>
			<p>Jesus called his disciples to become a new family, one that transcends racial, social, economic, and political boundaries. These groups seek to model his call. No one is left out; all are welcome.</p>
			<h3>Intergenerational Relationships</h3>
			<p>EP has five generations living together in community. Renew Groups will intentionally, though not legalistically, seek to represent our intergenerational demographic.</p>
			<h3>Interdependence</h3>
			<p>We need each other. Discipleship and mission are not possible without deep connectedness and reliance on others.</p>
			<h3>Outward Facing</h3>
			<p>EP aims to be a church where life-long disciples and non-believers can enjoy one another and find common ground. Renew Groups recognize this and seek the well-being of all.</p>
			<h3>Open for Processing</h3>
			<p>Application and practice is vital for Renew Groups, thus they will seek to help people lovingly yet critically engage with our culture, recognizing our role in shaping it. No one person or demographic has a corner on truth; we must learn, process, and apply together.</p>
