				<h2>Positioning You to Live with Meaning and Purpose</h2>
				<p>People seek meaning and purpose because we want to make sense of the world. So often, however, we lack the clarity to see what creates meaning and purpose and what just adds clutter and noise.</p>
				<p>Everyone knows we live in a cluttered, noisy world. Politics, religion, the economy&mdash;it all gets so loud. </p>
				<p>Of course, the problem goes deeper still. It turns out that we ourselves are often cluttered and noisy. We struggle at work or to form deep, meaningful relationships. We are anxious about our kids succeeding in school or our financial situation. We just received a difficult diagnosis or lost a family member.</p>
				<p>In short, life is difficult and often lonely, and you can get stuck and discouraged. We know how you feel, and we don&rsquo;t think you should have to go it alone. In fact, we are a supportive, loving group of people that not only shares the same issues, but wants to walk together with you in your own.</p>
				<p>Turns out that being with others is one of the most powerful meaning-making activities. Community helps people live healthier, more meaningful and purpose-driven lives.</p>
				<p>It&rsquo;s true, being with people can be tough and won&rsquo;t immediately solve our problems. But it helps. The people of <abbr title="Evangelical Presbyterian Church">EP</abbr> know what it means to struggle at work and to be anxious about our kids and finances. We know what it is to face medical problems and broken relationships.</p>
				<p>We also know what it is to find meaning and purpose in life. People in our community are making an impact in their families, workplaces, and communities. From working in low incoming housing areas to supporting retired veterans, our people gather to renew our families, our communities, and our world.</p>
				<p>We want to empower you to do the same. And we know how to do it. We&rsquo;ve helped hundreds of people step into a life of meaning and purpose. Lives have been changed. People go to work with a hop in their step. Parents raise wonderful children. Anxiety-inducing problems like financial or medical struggles become more manageable.</p>
				<p>Come and see what community can do for you, and then step into a life of meaning and purpose and beauty.</p>

			<!-- Eight Words - More Meaning and Purpose -->
			<article>
				<h2>Renew Every Human Life and All Creation</h2>
				<p>We didn&rsquo;t make up this meaning and purpose stuff. We believe in a God who designed us to find meaning and purpose in him, and that his Son Jesus has the answers to life&rsquo;s most pressing questions, and that in community with him and with each other we can work towards living out those answers.</p>
				<p>That&rsquo;s right, no matter how broken this world is&mdash;and it <em>is</em> broken&mdash;we believe that God&rsquo;s ultimate purpose is to renew every human life and all creation, and that we find meaning as we participate in his work to help make it so.</p>
				<p>We believe we were designed for this task. We also believe that design is not our idea, thus it cannot be of our making. Rather, Jesus shows us what true renewal, redemption, and restoration look like. (This is the Gospel.)</p>
				<p>Sound wild? That&rsquo;s okay. We know you may believe differently. That&rsquo;s why we are committed to hearing your story and sharing ours and engaging in the conversation. (<a href="#">Read more about what you can expect from us</a>.)</p>
				<p>If you find yourself interested, here are a few things we believe God is passionate about and calls us to join him in:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Redeem brokenness, hurt, and pain in Annapolis. (We live and work in communities that need love, care and protection; we want to help in that.)</li>
					<li>Restore people, relationships, families, and communities. (Whether you or someone you know is struggling with addition, broken relationships, divorce, loneliness, medical issues&mdash;whatever&mdash;we have a group of people who want to walk alongside.</li>
					<li>Participate with God to make all things new. (We know Christians can come across as wanting to escape this world, but that&rsquo;s not us. We believe God&rsquo;s plan is to make all things new, so we love this planet and the people in it and want to see them thrive and flourish.)</li>
					<li>Make peace, seek justice, and practice mercy. (We all know there are many problems in this world, and we want to help stop and confront injustice, clarify the issues and compel people to act, celebrate and cultivate what is going right, and create and catalyze change in our families, communities, and city.)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Some come and join us one Sunday to begin (or continue) to step into a life of meaning and purpose.</p>
