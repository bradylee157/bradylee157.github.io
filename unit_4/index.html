					<h2>Positioning You to Live with Meaning and Purpose</h2>
					<p>People seek meaning and purpose because we want to make sense of the world. So often, however, we lack the clarity to see what creates meaning and purpose and what just adds clutter and noise.</p>
					<p>Everyone knows we live in a cluttered, noisy world. Politics, religion, the economy&mdash;it all gets so loud. </p>
					<p>Of course, the problem goes deeper still. It turns out that we ourselves are often cluttered and noisy. We struggle at work or to form deep, meaningful relationships. We are anxious about our kids succeeding in school or our financial situation. We just received a difficult diagnosis or lost a family member.</p>
					<p>In short, life is difficult and often lonely, and you can get stuck and discouraged.</p>
					<p>We know how you feel, and we don&rsquo;t think you should have to go it alone.</p>
					<p>In fact, we are a supportive, loving group of people that not only shares the same issues, but wants to walk together with you in your own.</p>
					<p>Turns out that being with others is one of the most powerful meaning-making activities. Community helps people live healthier, more meaningful and purpose-driven lives.</p>
					<p>It&rsquo;s true, being with people can be tough and won&rsquo;t immediately solve our problems. But it helps. The people of <abbr title="Evangelical Presbyterian Church">EP</abbr> know what it means to struggle at work and to be anxious about our kids and finances. We know what it is to face medical problems and broken relationships.</p>
					<p>We also know what it is to find meaning and purpose in life. People in our community are making an impact in their families, workplaces, and communities. From working in low incoming housing areas to supporting retired veterans, our people gather to renew our families, our communities, and our world.</p>
					<p>We want to empower you to do the same. And we know how to do it. We&rsquo;ve helped hundreds of people step into a life of meaning and purpose. Lives have been changed. People go to work with a hop in their step. Parents raise wonderful children. Anxiety-inducing problems like financial or medical struggles become more manageable.</p>
					<p>Come and see what community can do for you, and then step into a life of meaning and purpose and beauty.</p>
